```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. Set up Google API credentials</b></summary>

1. Create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the required APIs:
   - Google Places API Web Service
   - Google Calendar API
   - People API (Contacts)
   - Gmail API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Desktop app" as the application type
   - Give it a name and click "Create"
   - Download the JSON file
4. **Important**: Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json` and place it in the project root directory
5. Create API key for Places API:
   - Go to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Restrict the key to only the Google Places API
   - Copy this key to your `.env` file as `GPLACES_API_KEY`
6. When you first run the application and try to use calendar or email features, it will:
   - Open a browser window for authentication
   - Ask you to sign in to your Google account
   - Request permission to access your calendar, contacts, and email
   - After granting permission, it will create a `token.json` file for future use
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. Special Setup Instructions for Blind Users</b></summary>

### Important: One-Time Authentication Process

For blind users, the Google OAuth authentication process requires sighted assistance **only once** during initial setup:

1. **Initial Setup (One-Time with Assistance)**:
   - After installing the application, the first time you use any Google service (calendar, contacts, email), 
     the system will need authentication
   - A browser window will open with Google's authentication page
   - **This step requires sighted assistance** to complete the login and permission granting
   - The assistant should:
     - Help navigate to the URL provided in the console
     - Log in to the blind user's Google account
     - Grant the requested permissions
     - Confirm when the "Authentication successful" message appears

2. **After Initial Setup (No Assistance Needed)**:
   - The system creates a `token.json` file that stores authentication securely
   - This token remains valid indefinitely with regular use
   - No further visual authentication is typically needed
   - Re-authentication is only required if access is explicitly revoked or unused for months

3. **Long-Term Solution (Optional)**:
   - For completely independent use, a developer can modify the application to use Service Account authentication
   - This alternative method doesn't require browser authentication but needs more technical setup
   - Contact the support email below if you need help implementing this solution

## 🧩 Challenges and Solutions

### Privacy-Preserving Vision

**Challenge:** GPT-4o sometimes refuses to describe people in images due to privacy guardrails.

**Solution:**
1. Llama model first checks for presence of people in images
2. Route to appropriate model based on content (GPT-4o for no people, Llama for people)
3. Response normalization for consistent user experience

### Performance Optimization

**Approaches:**
* ⚡ Efficient API client configuration
* 🖼️ Image preprocessing and optimization
* ⏱️ Parallel processing where appropriate
* 🌊 Response streaming for immediate feedback

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Google API Authentication Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|:------|:---------|
| "credentials.json file not found" | Ensure you've renamed the downloaded OAuth credentials file to `credentials.json` and placed it in the project root directory |
| "Token has been expired or revoked" | The application handles token refreshing automatically. Once authenticated, you typically won't need to log in again unless you explicitly revoke access in your Google account or don't use the application for an extended period (months). If re-authentication is ever needed, sighted assistance would be required only for that one-time process. |
| Authentication window doesn't open | Run the application from a terminal with GUI access. If using SSH, ensure X11 forwarding is enabled |
| Calendar events not showing | Check that you've enabled the Calendar API in Google Cloud Console and granted the necessary permissions |
| Contacts not found | Verify that you've enabled the People API and that contacts exist in your Google Contacts |
| Email sending fails | Make sure you've enabled "Less secure app access" in your Google account or generated an App Password if using 2FA |

### General Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|:------|:---------|
| Missing dependencies | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages |
| API keys not working | Double-check your `.env` file for correct API keys and ensure all services are properly configured |
| Camera not enabling | Ensure your device has a camera and the necessary permissions are granted |
| Voice not working | Check your microphone settings and verify Deepgram API key is valid |

## 🎭 Virtual Avatar Integration (Optional)

The assistant can be configured to use a virtual avatar when interacting with users through video calls, which can be particularly helpful for blind users when communicating with sighted individuals.

<details>
<summary><b>Avatar Setup Instructions</b></summary>

### Tavus Virtual Avatar Integration

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Sign up for a [Tavus](https://tavus.com) account
   - Create a replica (virtual avatar)
   - Generate an API key

2. **Installation**:
   - The required dependencies are included in the requirements.txt file
   - Make sure you have `livekit-agents[tavus]` and `livekit-plugins-tavus` installed

3. **Configuration**:
   Add the following to your `.env` file:
   ```
   # Tavus virtual avatar configuration
   ENABLE_AVATAR=true
   TAVUS_API_KEY=your_tavus_api_key
   TAVUS_REPLICA_ID=your_replica_id
   TAVUS_PERSONA_ID=your_persona_id
   TAVUS_AVATAR_NAME=ally-vision-avatar
   ```

4. **Persona Setup**:
   You need to create a Tavus persona with specific settings using the Tavus API:
   ```bash
   curl --request POST \
     --url https://tavusapi.com/v2/personas \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "x-api-key: <your-tavus-api-key>" \
     -d '{
       "layers": {
           "transport": {
               "transport_type": "livekit"
           }
       },
       "persona_name": "Ally Assistant Avatar",
       "pipeline_mode": "echo"
   }'
   ```
   - Save the `id` from the response as your `TAVUS_PERSONA_ID`
   - Use your replica ID as `TAVUS_REPLICA_ID`

5. **When to Use**:
   - Professional meetings where visual presence helps
   - Family video calls with sighted relatives
   - Educational or work environments
   - Any situation where blind users benefit from having a visual representation

The avatar will automatically handle the audio output when enabled, creating a seamless experience for both the blind user and sighted participants in the conversation.
